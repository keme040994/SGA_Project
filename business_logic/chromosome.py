# CLASS: Chromosome
class Chromosome:
    """
    This class contains the structure that is necessary for every individual in a population. It also has some auxiliary
    methods used by other external functions.

    Args:
        genes : MATRIX[[INT, INT, ...], [INT, INT, ...], ...]
            This matrix is the representation of the genes

    Attributes:
        genes : MATRIX[[INT, INT, ...], [INT, INT, ...], ...]
            The matrix associated with the class, representing the genes
        likelihood_result : FLOAT
            A value calculated by the likelihood function selected by the user, very important to measure the quality of
            the genes
        relative_likelihood_result : FLOAT
            An important value, calculated based on the likelihood result by external functions
        fitness : FLOAT
            This final value is calculated for selection purpose based on the population sorted by the relative
            likelihood result
