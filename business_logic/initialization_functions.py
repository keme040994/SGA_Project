def seed_population(pop_size, cant_genes, per_ones, likelihood_function, rep):
    """
    An algorithm to create a more diverse first population. Based on the following steps:
        1) Randomly generate N DAGS (generate N DGs and then fix). Compute relative likelihoods for these N
        2) From the N DAGS, keep top 15% (unique), complete the 85% randomly. Compute relative likelihoods
        3) From the N DAGS, keep top 30% (unique), complete the 70% randomly. Compute relative likelihoods
        4) From the N DAGS, keep top 45% (unique), complete the 55% randomly. Compute relative likelihoods
        5) From the N DAGS, keep top 60% (unique), complete the 40% randomly. Compute relative likelihood
        6) From the N DAGS, keep top 75% (unique), complete the 25% randomly. Compute relative likelihoods
        7) From the N DAGS, keep top 90% (unique), complete the 10% randomly. Compute relative likelihoods
        8) From the N DAGS, keep top 60% (unique), complete the 40% by selecting from the N DAGS and mutating
        9) From the N DAGS, keep top 70% (unique), complete the 30% by selecting from the N DAGS and mutating
        10) From the N DAGS, keep top 80% (unique), complete the 20% by selecting from the N DAGS and mutating
